Idea
 The main idea of this project was to automate the booking of movie tickets for you. Since it mostly happens that you go online
 to book the tickets of your favourite movie, and just before you book the seat for yourself in an almost full theatre, it goes
 housefull. This code solves this problem since it is an automated code. You just have to fill in the required details and rest
 happens automatically. Also, you have to enter your card details since if I try to enter the card details myself, I will be
 compromising security.

Technology used and implementation details
 The code is completely developed in python language. And the main module used is selenium module. From selenium, Keys, By, 
 expected_conditions, WebDriverWait and Select has been imported. Apart from this, time and random have been imported.
 The comments have been added for reference.
